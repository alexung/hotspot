== Hotspot

We aim to foster a one-stop shop for code reviewers to go to while looking over others' code.  We plan to create a page that displays the file path, the number of commits, and the users that have committed to that certain file.

We are using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, the Github API, and Omniauth.
